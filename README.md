## To execute the code, first the file needs to be unzipped.

## The files and folders on unzipping are:
##        Folders : 1. citeseer (contains all text files)
##                  2. outputs (contains all outputs generated when I executed notebook)

##        Files : 1. HW2.ipynb
##                2. README.txt
##                3. HW1.pdf (Jupyter notebook in PDF format)

### My code submission is in the form a single Jupyter notebook named 'HW2'.
### I have properly shown which cells in the notebooks are for which  tasks.
### I have also put comments in each cell to explain the functionality and what the code does.
### I have also added docstring in each function to explain its input parameters return types.
